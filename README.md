## THESIS: CONVERSATIONAL AI FOR COGNITIVE DISTORTIONS

### ABSTRACT
Cognitive distortions are dreadful, recurring negative thought patterns. They
are a silent yet powerful force behind declining mental health that could
pave the way for prolonged emotional distress, often culminating in depression
if left unchecked. This thesis attacks this growing concern by introducing
a Conversational AI-powered application that detects these distortions while
engaging in chat exchanges with students.
The research begins with identifying the ten most common cognitive distortions,
such as all-or-nothing thinking, overgeneralization, emotional reasoning,
labelling, personalization, mind-reading, fortune-telling, magnification also
known as catastrophizing, should statements, and mental filter. The functionality
ties an LLM to a retrieval-augmented generation mechanism that incorporates
a vector database, ensuring contextually grounded responses through recursive
document splitting and history-aware retrievers. Ultimately, it integrates prompt
engineering techniques to rationalize messages fraught with cognitive nuances
from users.
The resulting system takes the form of an intelligent chatbot assistant that
provides a supportive space where University of Oulu students can reflect on their
thoughts in order to foster cognitive self-awareness and reduce mental distress
through soothing chat engagement
